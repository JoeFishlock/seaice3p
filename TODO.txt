* add forcing options for yearly forcing

* Use template pattern to implement different solvers

* Implement standard way of testing if different simulations run

* lax friedrich solver doesn't need to import forcing
Should be able to apply forcings only in the boundary conditions module.
At the moment this has broken down only because when calculating
the pressure solve we need to calculate the permeability which
requires the liquid fraction at the next timestep on the ghost grid.
We can remove this and just use the center values if we extend the
centered liquid fraction values to the edges at the top and bottom.
